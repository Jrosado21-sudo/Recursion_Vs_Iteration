This code is to use iteration and recursion to a number that you input. The code will first ask to input a number. After you do it will tell you the runtime difference between Iteration and Recursion. The runtime measures in nanoseconds the amount of time in which the number completes a rebonucci sequence. A rebonucci sequence is when a number is add by the two numbers previous to the number.
